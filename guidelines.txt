# GCL container convention

## LIFETIME

void container_init( container_t *this, ... )
	initializes a previously allocated container
	other memory allocations may occur
	the container must be allocated beforehand

container_t *container_new( ... )
	allocates a container, initializes it via container_init, then returns a pointer to the resulting container

void container_destroy( container_t *this )
	prepares the container for safe deletion
	the container is not deallocated
	other memory deallocations may occur

void container_delete( container_t *this )
	destroys the container via container_destroy, then deallocates the container
	do not use on statically allocated containers

## ITERATORS

an iterator should provide the following operations:
	read at current position
	write at current position
	get next position
	get previous position

an iterator can provide these additionnal operations:
	insert at current position
	erase at current position
